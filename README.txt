Fitbit Automatic Download
v0.0.1

This is a python program in development that will use the urllib2 library and the Fitbit API to automatically download the information if paired with either cron or the task scheduler in Windows. It is possible to write the data to a local sqlite3 database.

The benefit of this programs is to not have to pay for the yearly subscriptions for each piece of data that you wanted to track but forgot to.
